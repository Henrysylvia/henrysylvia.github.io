**Project Description:** This project involved analyzing global sales and performance data for BMW vehicles across multiple regions, models, and years. Designed in Excel, the dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of key metrics including engine size, mileage, price, transmission type, fuel type, and sales classification. It enables stakeholders to explore trends and patterns in vehicle demand, profitability, and regional performance. The dashboard includes interactive filters for region, model, year, fuel type, and transmission, allowing for targeted analysis and strategic insights.
Key features include:

•	Relationship between engine size, mileage, and price across models

•	Demand for hybrid and electric cars by region

•	Price and sales classification breakdown by fuel type and transmission

•	Top-performing models by sales and color

•	Sales performance by year and model

•	Regional sales distribution for top-selling models



**Key findings:** 

•	Regional Demand Patterns: Electric and hybrid vehicles showed higher demand in Europe and Asia, while petrol and diesel remained dominant in Africa and South America.

•	Model Performance: X1, i8, and 7 Series consistently ranked as top-selling models across multiple regions, with X1 leading in both high and low sales classifications.

•	Transmission Trends: Automatic transmission vehicles outperformed manual across all fuel types, especially in high sales classifications.

•	Color Preferences: Blue and white emerged as the most popular colors for top-selling models, with regional variations in preference.

•	Sales Over Time: Sales peaked in 2022 and 2024, indicating strong recent performance, while earlier years showed more volatility.

•	Price vs. Engine Size: Larger engine sizes correlated with higher prices and lower mileage, particularly in premium models like the X6 and M5.
