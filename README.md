# Project 1

**Title:** [BMW Global Sales & Performance Dashboard](https://github.com/Henrysylvia/henrysylvia.github.io/blob/main/BMW%20sales%20data%20(2010-2024)%20(1).xlsx)

**Tools Used:** MicroSoft Excel (Pivot Table, Pivot Chart, Slicers, Data Cleaning & Preparation, Conditional Formating, Line Chart, Bar charts, Pie Chart, and Clustered Column Chart)

**Project Description:** This project analysed BMW’s global sales and performance data to understand market trends, model performance, and customer demand across regions, fuel types, and transmission types. Built in Excel, the dashboard turns a multi-dimensional dataset into an interactive view of key metrics such as pricing, engine size, mileage, sales volume, and colour preferences.

Users can explore performance by region, model, and year, and examine how technical features and fuel types relate to sales outcomes. Interactive slicers support quick comparisons and help identify high‑performing segments and emerging opportunities.
Key features include:

•	Regional sales overview: Comparison of sales across major global regions.

•	Model performance: Sales trends across BMW’s core model ranges.

•	Engine, mileage and price insights: Relationships between technical specifications and pricing.

•	Fuel type and transmission breakdown: Sales distribution across Petrol, Diesel, Hybrid, Electric, and Automatic vs Manual.

•	Hybrid and electric demand: Regional interest in sustainable vehicle options.

•	Year-on-year trends: Sales performance across multiple years.

•	Interactive filtering: Slicers for region, model, year, fuel type, transmission, and sales classification.


**Key findings:** 

•	Sales performance varies significantly by region: Some markets consistently outperform others, reinforcing the need for region specific sales and marketing strategies.

•	Engine size, mileage, and pricing show clear relationships: Larger engines and higher mileage generally align with higher pricing, reflecting expected performance driven pricing patterns.

•	Hybrid and electric vehicles show growing demand: Certain regions demonstrate strong interest in sustainable vehicle options, signalling a shift toward low emission models.

•	Fuel type and transmission influence sales classification: Automatic vehicles—especially petrol and hybrid—are more commonly associated with higher sales classifications, suggesting a preference for convenience and performance.

•	A few top models drive most of the sales: A small number of models contribute a large share of total sales, making them central to BMW’s global revenue.

•	Colour preferences influence purchasing decisions: Sales patterns show that colour choice plays a role in customer behaviour, particularly for top selling models.

•	Sales remain steady across multiple years: Year on year performance shows stability rather than volatility, reflecting strong brand positioning and consistent demand.

# Project 2

**Title:** [Wellbeing Insights: Degital Habits and Mental Wellbeing](https://github.com/Henrysylvia/henrysylvia.github.io/blob/main/Wellbeing%20Insights%20Dashboards.xlsx)

**Tools Used:** MicroSoft Excel (KPIs, Pivot Table, Pivot Chart, Slicers, Data Cleaning & Preparation, Conditional Formating, Line chart, 3-D Clustered Bar, 3-D Column, and Custom Combination)

**Project Description:** This project focused on analysing digital habits and wellbeing data to understand how screen time, social media use, sleep quality, exercise, and demographic factors relate to overall mental wellbeing. The work was completed in Excel, using formulas, calculated fields, and interactive visuals to turn raw survey-style data into clear, practical insights.

The dashboard brings together key wellbeing indicators such as happiness, stress levels, sleep duration, screen time, and exercise frequency, and shows how these differ across age groups, gender, and social media platforms. It was designed to help users explore patterns and relationships in the data, making it easier to identify behaviours linked to higher stress or improved wellbeing.
Key features of the dashboard include:

•	Overall wellbeing KPIs: Summary metrics showing average happiness, stress, sleep time, and screen time.

•	Demographic analysis: Wellbeing indicators broken down by gender and age range to highlight group-level trends.

•	Digital behaviour insights: Comparison of social media platforms to understand their relationship with happiness and stress.

•	Lifestyle factors: Exploration of how exercise frequency and social media breaks influence stress and sleep quality.

•	Interactive filtering: Slicers for gender, age, sleep quality, stress level, exercise frequency, happiness index, and platform to support flexible analysis.

The dashboard supports discussions around digital wellbeing and can be used to inform wellbeing programmes, workplace initiatives, or behavioural research.




**Key findings:** 

•	Digital habits are closely linked to wellbeing: Higher screen time and certain platforms are associated with increased stress and lower happiness, suggesting that digital behaviour plays a meaningful role in mental wellbeing.

•	Wellbeing patterns vary by age: Stress, sleep quality, and happiness differ across age groups, with some groups showing higher stress alongside reduced sleep, pointing to the value of age specific wellbeing support.

•	Different platforms have different impacts: Social media platforms show distinct relationships with happiness and stress, indicating that the type of platform used matters as much as the amount of time spent.

•	Exercise contributes to better wellbeing: More frequent exercise is linked to higher happiness and lower stress, reinforcing its role as a protective factor for mental health.

•	Taking breaks from social media helps: People who take regular breaks report better sleep and lower stress, showing that small adjustments in digital habits can have positive effects.

•	Gender differences are evident: Stress levels, happiness, and screen time vary across genders, highlighting the importance of considering demographic context when interpreting wellbeing data.
